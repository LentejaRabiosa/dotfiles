# My shitty . files
There must be a script to install arch.

## Minimal
This is the minimal version of my system. No color scheme. No fancy stuff.

 - WM: sway + i3status-rust
 - Terminal: foot

## Full setup
These are all the configuration files for the tools I use in my daily workflow.
The color scheme is based on Kanagawa Dragon.

 - Terminal: foot
 - Code editor: Neovim (Helix)
